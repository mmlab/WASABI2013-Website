## Topics Of Interest

Topics for presentation and discussion at the workshop include both technical and usage-oriented issues. They include everything that helps improve and shortening development and deployment time for an academic or a practitioner, wishing to work with semantic technologies. 

* Surveys or case studies on Semantic Web technology in enterprise systems
* Semantic Technology Market Analysis
* Comparative studies on the evolution of Semantic Web adoption
* Semantic systems and architectures of methodologies for industrial challenges
* Semantic Web based implementations and design patterns for enterprise systems 
* Enterprise platforms using Semantic Web technology as part of the workflow
* Architectural overviews for Semantic Web systems 
* Design patterns for semantic technology architectures and algorithms 
* System development methods as applied to semantic technologies 
* Semantic toolkits for enterprise applications 
* Surveys on identified best practices based on Semantic Web technology 
* Linked Data integration and change management

Of special interest are papers that touch upon the issues discussed during the brainstorming sessions of WaSABi 2014 at ESWC (proceedings forthcoming): 

* Linked Data lifecycle management: How can the longevity of key URIs and namespaces be guaranteed? Are such resources too important infrastructure or community assets to leave to commercial actors? How does one handle change management in a linked data context? How can software be analysed to find (potentially dangerous) dependencies on distributed Semantic Web resources?
* Software development for the Semantic Web: Are traditional software engineering methods well suited to the development of solutions for the Semantic Web? How can the complexity of the Semantic Web technology stack be abstracted or simplified (e.g. ORM for RDF)? Can Semantic Web software components run unchanged on cloud computing platforms, or how must they be adapted?

Additionally, industrial papers that focus on approaches, architectures, or tools demonstrating best practices in Semantic Web technologies are particularly encouraged.

## Submissions

Submission criteria are as follows:

* Papers must adhere to the [LNCS format guidelines](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0).

* Papers are submitted in PDF format via [the workshop's EasyChair submission pages](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wasabi2015). 

Accepted authors are given a presentation time slot of 15 minutes, with 5 minutes Q&A.
