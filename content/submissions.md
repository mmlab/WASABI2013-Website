### Description

The workshop aims to helps to guide the conversation between the scientific research community and IT practitioners with an eye towards the establishment of best practices for the development and deployment of Semantic Web based technologies. Both research and industry communities can benefit from this discussion by sharing use cases, user stories, practical development issues, and design patterns.

### Topics

Authors are invited to consider the following (non exhaustive) list of topics:

- Surveys or case studies on Semantic Web technology in enterprise systems
- Comparative studies on the evolution of Semantic Web adoption
- Semantic systems and architectures of methodologies for industrial challenges
- Semantic Web based implementations and design patterns for enterprise systems
- Enterprise platforms using Semantic Web technology as part of the workflow
- Architectural overviews for Semantic Web systems
- Design patterns for semantic technology architectures and algorithms
- System development methods as applied to semantic technologies
- Semantic toolkits for enterprise applications
- Surveys on identified best practices based on Semantic Web technology
- Linked Data integration and change management

The above list is not exhaustive and we therefore actively encourage participants to be creative.
A final goal is to provide future initiatives with the devised ideas and visions to stimulate innovation in this research area.

### Submissions

Contributions to the workshop can be made in the form of long research or experience papers, or short position papers. Both categories of submissions should adhere to the [LNCS format guidelines](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0) and be submitted in PDF format.

Papers that focus on uptake surveys, case studies, and new approaches, architectures, or tools demonstrating best practices in Semantic Web technologies are particularly encouraged. Paper submissions to the WaSABi workshop are limited to 8 pages. Accepted authors are given a time slot of 15 minutes, followed by 5 minutes Q&A.
