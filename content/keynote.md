##Crossing the Chasm with Semantic Technologies
**Marin Dimitrov, CTO Ontotext**

[Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/marin_dimitrov/wa-sa-bi2014crossingthechasm)

After more than a decade of active efforts towards establishing Semantic Web, Linked Data and related standards, the verdict of whether the technology has delivered its promise and has proven itself in the enterprise is still unclear, despite the numerous existing success stories.

Every emerging technology and disruptive innovation has to overcome the challenge of “crossing the chasm” between the early adopters, who are just eager to experiment with the technology potential, and the majority of the companies, who need a proven technology that can be reliably used in mission critical scenarios and deliver quantifiable cost savings.

Succeeding with a Semantic Technology product in the enterprise is a challenging task involving both top quality research and software development practices, but most often the technology adoption challenges are not about the quality of the R&D but about successful business model generation and understanding the complexities and challenges of the technology adoption lifecycle by the enterprise.

This talk will discuss topics related to the challenge of “crossing the chasm” for a Semantic Technology product and provide examples from Ontotext’s experience of successfully delivering Semantic Technology solutions to enterprises.
