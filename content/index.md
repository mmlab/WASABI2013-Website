Welcome to the WaSABi2015 workshop homepage.

## The challenge
The WaSABi workshop aims at helping to guide the conversation between the scientific research community, IT practitioners and industry. The workshop helps to establish best practices for the development, deployment and evaluation of Semantic Web based technologies. Both research and industry communities can benefit greatly from this discussion by sharing use cases, user stories, practical development issues, and design patterns. The goal of this particular workshop is to analyse the emerging Semantic Technology market, identify and apply appropriate methodologies, highlight success stories and overall support increase industry adoption of Semantic Web technologies.

## The solution
The gap between the Semantic Web research and industry practitioner communities, as evidenced by the limited uptake of very promising technologies in the broader market needs to be addressed. Researchers steadily improve upon modelling, query languages, reasoners, triple stores, and development tooling - but all too often, these improvements are driven not by real business needs, but intrinsically by the interests of researchers to work on and solve interesting challenges (e.g., more complex reasoning tasks), or to obtain government funding (e.g., for putting yet another public dataset online). Conversely, practitioners are oftentimes unaware of how existing Semantic Web technologies can help solve their problems (such as data or service integration, conflict detection and resolution, or event processing). Even in the cases that they do know about these Semantic Web solutions, most practitioners lack the knowledge about tooling, scalability issues, design patterns that are required in order to successfully apply the technology.

In order to help analyse and ultimately bridge this gap, the WaSABi organisers believe two things are needed: firstly, a greater understanding of industrial organisations and their needs among academics, guiding them in selecting problems to work on that are of direct relevance to practitioner partners, and secondly, the establishing of a set of methodolgies, evaluation strategies and best practices for Semantic Web technology development and use, guiding practitioners who want to apply these technologies. The WaSABi workshop provides a forum for discussing and developing solutions to both of these needs, neither of which can be solved by researchers or practitioners on their own.
