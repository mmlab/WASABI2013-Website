Welcome to the homepage of the WaSABi2014 ESWC workshop.

*14 March. 2014*: Submission deadline extended until *March 21st*!

## The challenge

In recent years Semantic Web based systems, applications and tools have shown significant improvement. Their increased deployment indicates a steady maturing of semantic technologies and demonstrates their value in solving current and emerging problems. Though the number of enterprises working on and with these technologies is dwarfed by the number who have not yet adopted semantic technologies. Possible reasons for this include lack of well known enterprise use cases and market dynamics in academia on the one hand, and lack of easy to use standard architectures, frameworks, and system design patterns on the other hand.

## Leading the Way - Best Practices
The workshop organizers believe that increased integration and dialog between research and industry is a necessary prerequisite if solutions to this technology adoption challenge are to be found. We aim to provide a venue for discussions supporting both an increased awareness of market dynamics among academics, and the development of better tooling and practices supporting industrial semantic technology adoption.

So far we have identified but are not limited to the following areas:

- The current disruptiveness of Semantic Web technology: past investments, time-to-market and compatibility with connected systems need to be considered. This raises concerns with new technologies – “Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM”, as an old saying goes – and making radical changes.
- The lack of architectural modelling approaches using Semantic Web technology: a successful tool stack for semantic technology development has not yet emerged, nor are there recommended system architectures for developing and deploying ontology- and RDF(S)-backed applications. Does the traditional three tier architecture suffice, or are other structures required?
- The existing gaps between academic research, applied research and industrial research and development: insecurity regarding which vocabularies, standards, and technologies will survive in the marketplace and are worth betting on and investing in. They might even be revised from time to time, which causes difficulties in distributed environments like the WWW.
- The lack of knowledge among laymen regarding suitable and scalable workflows for large amounts of semantic data. For instance, how much reasoning should take place at load time, and how much at query time? Should federated queries be used, or should data be batch imported and cached locally?
- The lack of coordination processes and routines in a distributed knowledge/data landscape: can a user or company trust that the data they rely on, which is provided by another party, will be of sufficient quality? Can data quality SLAs be established? How is the value of data to be calculated, and who is to pay who for what?
- The lack of knowledge among laymen regarding comparative strengths and weaknesses of competing semantic technologies: which reasoner is best for which type of use case? Which triple store? Is there any one such tool which is good enough in most cases to be a reasonable general recommendation?

The 2nd Workshop on Semantic Web Enterprise Adoption and Best Practice is intended to broaden the current focus of workshops at ESWC2014 to incorporate Semantic Web technologies from the perspective of enterprises and best practices for their applications. Topics for presentation and discussion at the workshop include both technical and usage-oriented issues. They include everything that helps shortening development and deployment time for an academic or a practitioner, wishing to work with semantic technologies.
