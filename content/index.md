## The challenge
There is a disconnect between the Semantic Web research and commercial practitioner communities, as evidenced by the limited uptake of these very promising technologies in the broader industry. Researchers steadily improve upon logic modelling and query languages, reasoners and triple stores, and development tooling - but all too often, these improvements are driven not by real business needs, but rather by the interests of researchers to work on and solve interesting challenges (e.g., more complex reasoning tasks), or to obtain government funding (e.g., for putting yet another public dataset online). Conversely, practitioners are oftentimes unaware of how existing Semantic Web technologies can help solve their problems (such as data or service integration, conflict detection and resolution, or event processing). Even in the cases that they do know about these Semantic Web solutions, most practitioners lack the knowledge about tooling, scalability issues, design patterns, etc., that is required in order to successfully apply them.

## The solution
In order to bridge this gap, the WaSABi organisers believe two things are needed: firstly, a greater understanding of industrial organisations and their needs among academics, guiding them in selecting problems to work on that are of direct relevance to practitioner partners, and secondly, the establishing of a set of best practices for Semantic Web technology development and use, guiding practitioners who want to apply these technologies. The 3rd Workshop on Semantic Web Enterprise Adoption and Best Practice at EKAW provides an arena for discussing and developing solutions to both of these needs, neither of which can be solved by researchers or practitioners on their own.
