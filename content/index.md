Welcome to the homepage of the WaSABi2014 ESWC workshop.

## The challenge

Over the years, *Semantic Web* based systems, applications, and tools have shown significant improvement. Their development and deployment shows the steady maturing of semantic technologies and demonstrates their value in solving current and emerging problems. Examples include enabling generic clients, facilitating autonomous agents and large scale distributed data integration. Despite the encouraging figures, the number of enterprises working on and with these technologies is dwarfed by the large number who have not yet adopted Semantic Web technologies. Current adoption is mainly restricted to methodologies provided by the research community. Although the Semantic Web acts as a candidate technology to the industry, it does not win through in current enterprise challenges like data fusion, data integration or natural language processing. To better understand the market dynamics uptake needs to be addressed and if possible quantified.

## Leading the Way - Best Practices
The workshop organizer team believes that an open dialog between research and industry is beneficial and aims at a discussion in terms of best practices for enabling better market access. The workshop will elicitate a set of best practices for the development and deployment of semantic technologies. So far we have identified but are not limited to the following areas:
- The current disruptiveness of Semantic Web technology: past investments, time-to-market and compatibility with connected systems need to be considered. This raises concerns with new technologies – “Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM”, as an old saying goes – and making radical changes.
- The lack of architectural modelling approaches using Semantic Web technology: A successful tool stack for semantic technology development has not yet emerged, nor are there recommended system architectures for developing and deploying ontology- and RDF(S)-backed applications. Does the traditional three tier architecture suffice, or are other structures required?
- The existing gaps between academic research, applied research and industrial research and development.
Insecurity regarding which vocabularies, standards, and technologies will survive in the marketplace and are worth betting on and investing in. They might even be revised from time to time which cause difficulties in distributed environments like the WWW.
- The lack of knowledge among laymen regarding suitable and scalable workflows for large amounts of semantic data. For instance, how much reasoning should take place at load time, and how much at query time? Should federated queries be used, or should data be batch imported and cached locally?
- The lack of coordination processes and routines in a distributed knowledge/data landscape. Can a user or company trust that the data they rely on, which is provided by another party, will be of sufficient quality? Can data quality SLAs be established? How is the value of data to be calculated, and who is to pay who for what?
- The lack of knowledge among laymen regarding comparative strengths and weaknesses of competing semantic technologies. Which reasoner is best for which type of use case? Which triple store? Is there any one such tool which is good enough in most cases to be a reasonable general recommendation?

The 2nd Workshop on Semantic Web Enterprise Adoption and Best Practice is intended to broaden the current focus of workshops at ESWC2014 to incorporate Semantic Web technologies from the perspective of enterprises and best practices for their application. Topics for presentation and discussion at the workshop include both technical and usage-oriented issues. They include everything that helps shortening development and deployment time for an academic or a practitioner, wishing to work with semantic technologies.
